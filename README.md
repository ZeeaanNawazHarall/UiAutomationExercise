# UI Training Assignment â€“ Playwright

##  Overview

This repository contains automated test cases for different UI components using **Playwright with TypeScript**.
The assignment includes:

* Ajax Submit Form
* Bootstrap List Box
* Checkbox Demo
* Drag and Drop Sliders
* JavaScript Alerts
* jQuery Dropdown

The goal of this project is to apply **Page Object Model (POM)** for test automation, keep a clean folder structure, and practice debugging & R\&D skills.
